# budgetandpay.py
This is my first program file made in Python besides Hello-World
It should calculate someone's approximate pay based only on the variables of hours worked, pay rate, and tax rate.
It also has a looping section for monthly expenses in which you can enter all your monthly expenses over and over again until you don't want to input anymore information.
